export const about = `
I am a fourth-year Computer Science student. I have started coding in the primary school and my programming passion has been growing ever since.
I specialize in FullStack Software Development. I worked with different technologies, although React, Node and Flutter are my favorites.  
In my free time I work as a music producer (creating mainly electronic genres). I am also a member of my university ski team, where I am actively participating in national academic skiing competitions.
