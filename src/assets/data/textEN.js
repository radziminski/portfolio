export const about = `
I am a third-year Computer Science student. I have started coding in the primary school and my programming passion has been growing ever since.
I specialize in full-stack web development. I worked with different technologies, although React.js and Node.js are my strong suits.  
In my free time, I work as a music producer (creating mainly electronic genres) on House Of Tracks (houseoftracks.com). I am also a member of the university ski team, where I am actively participating in national academic skiing competitions.
